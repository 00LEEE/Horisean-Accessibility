# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
# Description

- A common task for front-end and junior developers is to improve the quality of existing code by making it adhere to certain standards or by incorporating new technologies. One important aspect of this process is ensuring that websites are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities or limited financial resources. Web accessibility not only helps businesses serve a wider audience, but it can also prevent legal issues related to discrimination.

> **Important**: When working with someone else's code, you should adhere to the **Scout Rule**&mdash;always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it.

- An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

- Accessibility can include complex requirements, but your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria for this project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

- To impress clients, you should always exceed expectations and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
